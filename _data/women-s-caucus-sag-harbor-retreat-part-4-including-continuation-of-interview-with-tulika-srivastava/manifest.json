She explains how cultural pressure makes it difficult for women to report sexual crimes, as many believe that by discussing such topics in public is \"dirty.\" She relates a story in which a girl who was sexual abused had to fight with a police officer to force him to listen to her.

She says that the ICC can be a tool to raise domestic standards at home. Footage continues with Srivastava singing a song in Hindi to the group of women at the retreat. She explains that it is a song about mobilizing women to change the world. There is more singing and informal discussion about protest songs used as rally calls. Another woman talks about people singing \"We Shall Overcome,\" and the group begins to sing it.
